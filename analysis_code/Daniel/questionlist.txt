Questions:

1) Can we use emoji patterns to predict malicious and artificial tweets?
    -> MBA rules for emojis that go together
    -> Community detection using emojis as edges between tweets
    -> Emoji-based clustering

2) What are the tweets normally about?
    -> LDA topic modeling for sentiment analysis (oh fuck this will take forever :)
    -> PCA/KPCA for topic aggregation
    -> Link Anlaysis for finding "hub" tweets that disseminate information

3) How are the malicious links structured and used in tweets?
