There were 2234282 unique terms (word or emoji = term), filtered to 1060 unique terms using a minimum single-item support of 0.001 (3000+ unique occurences of a term). Without filtering I'd get errors due to the matrix requested to be fed into fpgrowth being larger than my laptop could handle. 

After filtering used the params for this run
Support: 0.001
Confidence: 0.1
Lift distance: 0.2
