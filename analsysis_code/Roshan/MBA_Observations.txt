We observe that for higher support values (~0.01) we get generic hashtags (like #news, #politics, etc.) which isnâ€™t quite useful for drawing conclusions. Reducing support to 0.005 and then generating the association rules based on the frequent itemsets thus obtained, we could uncover a lot of association rules. Analyzing these rules, we could observe rules that signal collaboration towards manipulating audiences. 

If we observe the top 20 association rules sorted by confidence (association_rules_lift15.csv) we can see that a few of the association rules listed below indicate suspicious activity:
(#tagderjugend)  ->   (#jugendmitmerkel)
(#stopthegop)    ->   (#gopdebate) 
(#brussels)      ->   (#islamkills) 
(#stopislam)     ->   (#islamkills)
(#trumptrain)    ->   (#maga)      (MAGA - Make America Great Again)

Especially considering the fact that these tweets were taken from Russian accounts, its suspicious to find high confidence and lift for hashtags regarding politics in America. Also a google search for the hashtags - (#tagderjugend) and (#jugendmitmerkel) reveals that tweets with these hashtags were part of a of a campaign by Russia's Internet Research Agency to disrupt the politics and elections of countries around the world.
